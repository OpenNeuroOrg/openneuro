# ORCID Logins

OpenNeuro supports account creation with [ORCID](https://orcid.org/). Creating an ORCID iD allows you to login to OpenNeuro, associate works with your profile, and gives OpenNeuro users interacting with datasets a mechanism to contact you or source your activity on OpenNeuro (datasets, comments, etc). OpenNeuro also displays your published name or given name on datasets you have uploaded or modified, and comments. In the future, related datasets discoverable via ORCID may be shown using your ORCID iD and name.

## Enabling Trusted Access to Emails

To use all features of OpenNeuro, you must make at least one email address available to OpenNeuro from your ORCID profile. The first email visible to OpenNeuro will be used for email notifications on your dataset and allows other users to associate permissions with your OpenNeuro account using this email address. OpenNeuro requires a minimum of trusted institutional access.

Visit [your ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/my-orcid) and add or modify an email.

Ensure that at least one email address is visible to everyone or trusted parties, and has been verified with ORCID.

Sign out and reauthenticate with OpenNeuro to update your OpenNeuro account after any email changes on your ORCID profile.
